Please Allow for qmail-inject to be triggered by Gnus through X-Message-SMTP-Method.

This would apply to emacs 29 and later.

Gnus uses X-Message-SMTP-Method for selection of Mail-Sending-Agent. Eventhough
  all the qmail injection code is still in Gnus, support for
  ``X-Message-SMTP-Method: qmail'' is missing. It takes 2 lines of code to
  revive it.

Please add the below two qmail lines to
message-multi-smtp-send-mail function in gnus/message.el

#+begin_src elisp

       ((equal (car method) "sendmail")
	(message-send-mail-with-sendmail))
       ((equal (car method) "qmail")
	(message-send-mail-with-qmail))
       ((equal (car method) "smtp")

#+end_src

Thank you.

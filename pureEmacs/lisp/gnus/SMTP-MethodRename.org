Please consider renaming X-Message-SMTP-Method to X-Message-Send-Method.

This would apply to emacs 29 and later.

Backwards compatibility is simple. Both would be valid for a while.

This is a terminology suggestion. The term X-Message-SMTP-Method violates
  conceptual layering. Please consider changing it to X-Message-Send-Method. In
  a Split-MUA setup, Gnus need not even know about SMTP at all. We just need to
  pass information to a Mail-Sending-Agent selector.

Furthermore through the X822-Bus, the Mail-Sending-Agent can even receive additional
parameters that Gnus need not even know about.

Thank you.
